# projet-dashboard
a microservice project, with express.js for the back and next/react in front, in which the user can authenticate, 
but also can use oauth2 with spotify (i didn't participate in this part).
The goal was to find several apis that we could display in a single page, with a minimal interaction. 
I used a Chuck Norris quote api, which display random quotes according to a selected category, and a 
news app, which gives the user the top 10 articles related to the topic inputed.
