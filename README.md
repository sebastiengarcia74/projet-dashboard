# projet-dashboard
a microservice project, in which the user can authenticate, but also can use oauth2 with spotify.
The goal was to find several apis that we could display in a single page, with a minimal interaction. 
I used a Chuck Norris quote api, which display random quotes according to a selected category, and a 
news app, which gives the user the top 10 articles related to the topic inputed.
